# StuBudget

<h3>
  A React Native mobile application allowing co-op students to budget for their work terms.
</h3>

The user enters the details for their earnings and length of the term, as well as recurring expenses, and is prompted to set a savings goal for the term.

After the savings goal has been set, the user will be updated with a weekly spending allowance to meet their savings goal.

When the user adds miscellaneous purchases, the remaining allowance for the given week will be updated.

User data is stored using Firebase.
